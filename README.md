# Voting in a Watts-Strogatz Small-World-Network

In this research project we simulated a two party majority voting scheme in a Wattz-Strogatz world network. Three different types of voting function were implemented and the results were compared.

### Abstract :
Social network science and social interaction science is an interesting and steadily growing field of
research in current time. Social network influences the lives of millions, and therefore the propagation of influence
in such a network deserves study. In this paper, we have studied voting in a Watts-Strogatz small world network for
two parties. In our model, each node has an initial bias towards one of the parties (or can be neutral) and are
influenced by their neighbours to vote for a particular party. We show via simulation that (i) for linear of logarithmic
voting function, the small scale variation is minimum, but the majority of the nodes tend to align towards one of the
parties in the long term, (ii) for periodic voting function, the small scale variations are sharp and oscillating, but in
the long term the number of voters in each party roughly remains the same, (iii) the degree of the graph does not
seem to have a strong influence on the result, and (iv) networks with higher small world probability tend to resist the
alignment of voters towards a particular party for a longer time as compared to networks with lower small world
probability. This majority voting model seems to efficiently capture the potential behaviour of voters on small world
network over a campaigning period.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

As this code is in the form of Google Colaboratory Notebook, you can start running the code straight from the browser. But if you're willing to run the code locally, you'd be needing the following packages
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
